# Final Project Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL 

## Project/Goals
My goal is to understand the data, so that I can create queries to provide results that can provide valuable insights to buisnesses.

## Process

1. Look into each CSV file and understand the data and datatypes 
2. Create tables and import CSV file to pgAdmin
3. See if any of the tables can be linked (referenitial relationship)
4. Look into each table and check columns for any outliers/NULL or duplicate data
5. Create queries using LIMIT/GROUP BY/ORDER to understand the data and see what valuable insights
6. Think through the perspective of a business and create queries that would be valuable to save money and generate more revenue. 

## Results

(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
1. uploading csv files to pGadmin (experienced technical issue)
2. Confusion about some columns and what they mean. For example, "FullVisitorId" and "VisitorId" - due to a lack of data dictionary, I couldn't find more information and had to make assumptions of some of the data.
3. I don't understand why there are more rows in the sales_by_sku table then the sales_report table. I understand that the sales_by_sku contains all the information about products that sold, so it would not have information on products that didn't sell. But sales_report table contains information about products whether they sold or not. So, I feel like there is incomplete information? 

## Future Goals
1. Use more complex SQL queries to get data results that would be valuable to clients.
2. Create a more sophisticated QA process.
